 ✋ Silence Bridging

Silence Bridging** is a web-based application that helps bridge communication between the Deaf and hearing communities through Tanzanian Sign Language (TSL) recognition. Using a webcam, the app captures hand landmarks in real-time and predicts the corresponding sign alphabet, providing both visual and audio feedback.
